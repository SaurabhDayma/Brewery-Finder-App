# Brewery-Finder-App
 have created a react app called "Brewery Search". Users can search breweries using keywords like State, City, Brewery name. I have used API data from Openbrewerydb.org. It's a simple app to try out my understanding of "React" that I learned through the General Assembly's class. I have learned a lot while working on this app.
